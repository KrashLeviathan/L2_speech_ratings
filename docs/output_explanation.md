Hi Nate,

My apologies for not getting this to you sooner.

- rater refers to the listener (typically 10-20 listeners evaluate all speakers
- block refers to the rating they were providing (fluency, comprehensibility, accentedness)
- id (and new.id) refers to the speaker (most of my studies have at least 20)
- wave (and semester) refers to two different conceptualizations of time (in this case, the
  variable includes 5 data sessions)
- target refers to the particular target item they were responding to (in this case, the
  sentence they were reading)
- task (which is not included here, would refer to the different tasks I have them complete,
  such as sentence reading, prompted response, or narration)
- ns refers to native speaker (whether or not the participant was a native speaker of Spanish
  or not)
- the other variables refer to particular individual differences in motivation linked to each
  participant at certain time points

Since in this data set 20 raters evaluated 5 sentences spoken by 20 speakers at each of
5 sessions for 2 features (only comprehensibility and accentedness in this study), the data
set contains approximately 20,000 rows, with each row representing a unique combination of
the variables I mentioned. 

Sincerely,
Charlie
