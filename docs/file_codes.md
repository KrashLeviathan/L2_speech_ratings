Hi Nathan,

I didn't get a chance to look up the instructions I typically give to participants,
but I will be on campus tomorrow so I can do it then. As for the study codes for the
audio files:

- Language (refers to the target language or L2): l1, l2, l3, l4, etc. (typically I
  only deal with Spanish, or Spanish and French, so at this stage it could simply
  be 'sp' and 'fr')
- Level (refers to the course in which the participant is enrolled at the outset of 
  the study): 101, 102, 201, 202, 300, 400
- ID (refers to the subject/participant): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.
- Wave (refers to data collection session/wave): w1, w2, w3, w4, etc.
- Task (refers to the specific speaking task): t1, t2, t3, t4, etc.
- Item (refers to the items within each task; can be used for subgrouping by phonetic
  features): i1, i2, i3, i4, etc.

I think that is all of the levels and codes I can come up with for now. I usually
insert underscores between the labels (e.g., sp_101_1_w1_t1), but I can stop doing
that if it messes up the programming.

Let me know if you have any questions,
Charlie
