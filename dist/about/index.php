                <p>Thank you for taking the time to participate in my research. I am an applied linguist and assistant
                    professor of Spanish in the Department of World Languages and Cultures at Iowa State University. In
                    my research, I study how individuals learn additional languages. In particular, I am interested in
                    how language learners' speaking ability changes over time.</p>
