                <p>Dr. Charles Nagle is an applied linguist and Assistant Professor of Spanish in the Department of
                    World Languages and Cultures at Iowa State University. His research broadly focuses on how
                    individuals learn additional languages. In particular, he examines how language learners' speaking
                    ability changes over time and the factors that predict that change. For more information, please
