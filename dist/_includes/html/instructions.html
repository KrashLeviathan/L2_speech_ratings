            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>You will hear audio clips spoken by both second language learners and native speakers
                of Spanish/French. What we would like you to do is make three judgments about each sample.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Comprehensibility</h3>
            <p>First, we will ask you to say how easy or difficult the sample is to understand, using a
                9-point scale. You might be able to understand everything but it may require a lot of
                effort on your part&mdash;so what we are interested in is the effort you put in. Can you
                understand it without even thinking about it, or do you have to work at it?</p>
            <p class="text-center l2sr-bold">
                1 = Very difficult to understand<br>
                9 = Very easy to understand</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Fluency</h3>
            <p>Second, we will ask you to rate fluency. This is the flow of the language&mdash;does the
                person have problems finding words, pausing often, or do the words come easily? Do not worry
                about grammar mistakes&mdash;that does not matter for this rating. Someone who is very
                fluent&mdash;that is, the words just flow with no struggle&mdash;would be at the right end of
                the scale, while someone who has a hard time expressing him or herself would be closer to
                the left end of the scale.</p>
            <p class="text-center l2sr-bold">
                1 = Extremely disfluent<br>
                9 = Extremely fluent</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Accentedness</h3>
            <p>Third, we are interested in accent. We all have accents, but we are interested in knowing
                how different the speakersâ€™ accents are from a native speaker of (Spanish/French) of any
                dialect or region. Accent is different from comprehensibility&mdash;you might be able to
                understand somebody easily and still hear a heavy accent.</p>
            <p class="text-center l2sr-bold">
                1 = Very strong foreign accent<br>
                9 = No foreign accent whatsoever</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h3>Scale</h3>
            <div class="btn-group center-block clearfix np-scale" role="group" aria-label="Nine-point scale">
                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">1</button>

                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">9</button>
            </div>
            <div class="l2sr-mbot-md">
                <p>We would like you to try to use the whole scale over the course of the experiment.
                    Please listen to the whole speech sample before making your
                    decisions. Once you have rated the clip, the program will automatically advance.</p>
