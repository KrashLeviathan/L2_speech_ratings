            <h3>What is the purpose of this research?</h3>
            <p>We are interested in the factors that shape second language speaking skills over time and listeners'
                perceptions of second language speech, such as how easy the speech is to understand. This particular
                study examines how language learners' speaking ability changes over time.</p>
            <h3>Will any information be collected about me?</h3>
            <p>You have been asked to create a username and password so that you can log back into the rating platform
                and carry out additional ratings in the future. Your username and password are confidential. The basic
                demographic data (age, gender, etc.) and language information you will provide will be linked to your
                username for the purpose of data analysis. However, all data is anonymous and confidential, and you will
                not be asked to provide your name or other identifying information.</p>

            <h3>What can I expect?</h3>
            <p>You will be asked to listen to speech clips provided by native speakers and language learners at various
                proficiency levels. Depending on the particular task the speakers completed, you will hear short
                sentences or longer stretches of speech of approximately 20-40 seconds. After you listen to the audio,
                you will be asked to rate the speech for comprehensibility, fluency, and accentedness, explained in
                detail below. Audio files have been grouped into blocks to make it easier to move through the ratings.
                You should expect to spend about 30 minutes per block. After each block, you will be able to take a
                break before moving onto the next block.</p>
            <p>In general, you will be asked to rate between 2-5 blocks of files, which should take approximately 1-2
                hours. You do not have to rate all blocks in one sitting, but you must complete each block that you
                start. You will also be asked to complete a basic background questionnaire relating to your educational
                experiences and the languages that you speak.</p>

            <h3>Do I need headphones?</h3>
            <p>You should find a quiet space free of distractions to complete this experiment. If possible, you should
                also use headphones to listen to the audio files so that you hear them as clearly as possible. The
                ratings you will be asked to provide require you to listen closely to each audio, so please make every
                effort to find a quiet space where you can concentrate.</p>
