# ESL Ratings Website

## Goal

The goal is to create a web application that facilitates Dr. Nagleâ€™s
research on second language pronunciation development. It will feature
the ability for users to log in to the system with a
unique access code and rate a sampling of audio files on a scale of
1 to 9. The results can then be downloaded as a CSV file by the
administrator for use in language research.
