# ESL Ratings Website

## Goal

The goal is to create a web application that facilitates Dr. Nagleâ€™s
research on second language pronunciation development. It will feature
the ability for users to log in to the system with a
unique access code and rate a sampling of audio files on a scale of
1 to 9. The results can then be downloaded as a CSV file by the
administrator for use in language research.

## Development Notes

The following commands are for your local copy:

```bash
# Start the server
tools/serve.sh

# Re-initialize the database
tools/reinitialize_database.sh

# MySql server commands
/etc/init.d/mysql start
/etc/init.d/mysql stop
/etc/init.d/mysql restart
/etc/init.d/mysql status
```

### Dev Server

The dev server is `l2speechratings-dev.las.iastate.edu`. To access, you'll
need to VPN into `iastate.edu` first. The following commands/directories
are for the dev server:

```bash
# Apache server commands
systemctl restart httpd24-httpd

# php-fpm commands
systemctl restart rh-php70-php-fpm

# httpd.conf location
/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# VirtualHost location
/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/sites-enabled/l2speechratings-dev.las.iastate.edu.80.conf

# Git repository clone is located at
/var/www/html/L2_speech_ratings

# Files are served from:
/opt/rh/httpd24/root/var/www/html/
# which contains symlinks to:
/var/www/html/config.txt
/var/www/html/l2speechratings
/var/www/html/vendor

# LOGS
#   httpd error log
/var/log/httpd24/error_log
#   php error log
/var/opt/rh/rh-php70/log/php-fpm/www-error.log

# PHP Info
http://l2speechratings-dev.las.iastate.edu/phpinfo.php

# MySQL Client
mariadb
```

## Deployment

I'd like to eventually make a build script or something that does all this, but until it's all
figured out, it will have to be done manually.

1. VPN into the ISU network
2. SSH into the server
3. Become superuser to make changes: `sudo su`
4. `cd /var/www/html/L2_speech_ratings` (this is just code from the repo -- it's
   not served)
5. Pull changes: `git pull`
6. Remove previously-served files: `cd ..; rm -r l2speechratings/*`
7. Copy the dist folder to the serve location: `cd l2speechratings; cp -r ../L2_speech_ratings/dist/* .`
8. Open `l2speechratings/_includes/config.php` and comment/uncomment the
   appropriate lines (at the top and bottom)
9. Make sure to create the following folders in `l2speechratings`:
   ```bash
   mkdir file_storage
   mkdir file_storage/audio_samples
   mkdir file_storage/demographics
   mkdir file_storage/results
   mkdir file_storage/survey_completions
   ```
10. If config.txt has been changed:
   - `cd /var/www/html; cp L2_speech_ratings/config.txt .` (NOTE: This file
     is actually pointed to by a symbolic link at /opt/rh/httpd24/root/var/www/html)
11. If php.ini has been changed:
    - Copy the `php.ini` file into the appropriate location
    - Restart the PHP server
12. If `composer.lock` has changed since the last release:
    - Right now, since composer isn't working correctly on the server, you need to use `scp` to
      copy the vendor folder to the server. `scp -r nkarasch@l2speechratings-dev.las.iastate.edu:/home/nkarasch`
    - Then ssh into the server and copy `/home/nkarasch/vendor` to `/var/www/html/vendor`
